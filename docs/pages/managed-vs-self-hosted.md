# Managed vs Self-hosted

I have choosen to self hosted option for this case study due to my personal constraints (currently don't have any public cloud setup).

However, I would have prefered to use Managed Services, heres why:

* Minimal administrative overhead
* Automatic updates and backups
* Easy scalability
* High availability and reliability

The above benifits of course don't come for free. When choosing to use managed services you should consider the following:

* Managed services can be expensive depending on use case
* Potential vendor lock-in for specific services i.e. dynamodb
